Here are a few representative project themes. (Write brief, high‑level summaries. Avoid proprietary details; link only to public repos.)


### Interactive Analytics Dashboards
Short description of an interactive dashboard project, focusing on the problem it solves and the impact of clear visuals.


### Machine Learning Workflows
High‑level summary of a modeling task (e.g., classification/regression/NLP), what was learned, and how you'd extend it.


### Data Storytelling Experiments
Brief write‑ups where you explored a dataset, built a visualization, or wrote an article explaining insights.


> Tip: For each project, include a 2–3 sentence abstract, bullet the stack (R, Python, Shiny, Quarto, etc.), and link to a public demo or GitHub repo if available.
