# Kelvin Ervais


**Data science & analytics** with a focus on practical tools, ML modeling, and clear storytelling. I build interactive dashboards (often in R Shiny), explore end‑to‑end ML workflows in R/Python, and care about turning complex datasets into decisions.


**Interests:** modern ML, open‑source tooling, data engineering best practices, and the broader field of **baseball analytics** (as an area of study and curiosity).
