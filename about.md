Hi! I'm **Kelvin Ervais**, a data science/analytics practitioner who enjoys:


- Building practical, maintainable analytics tools
- Prototyping ML models and evaluating them with honest metrics
- Crafting interactive visuals and dashboards that make data approachable


I primarily work in **R and Python**, and I like lightweight, readable solutions over flashy complexity.


**Beyond work**: I follow developments in AI/LLMs, reproducible analytics, and the field of **baseball analytics** for its rich combination of data, modeling, and strategy.
